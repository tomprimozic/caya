# Caya - a programming language experiment

## Goals

- a useful yet simple language
- not aiming for performance _per se_, but choosing constructs and patterns that _can be_ optimised
- interactive, optionally statically typed, functional & imperative, simple & predictable syntax & semantics

#### current priorities

1. implement enough features to stop using host language for library implementation
2. bytecode interpreter (and overall refactor, e.g. a single immutable `HashMap.empty` object)
3. performance improvements

## Implementation

We use Java / JVM as the host platform.

Java has improved a lot in recent years - records, pattern matching, `var` type inference - so it's not terrible to use any more. In addition, `bison` (parser generator) can generate Java parsers.

JVM is one of the few runtimes with a sensible memory model (no _undefined behaviour_ - the other being _OCaml_) and has great support for concurrency (threading) and memory management (garbage collection). It generates decently fast code and enables interesting optimisation strategies in the future (directly generating JVM bytecode, Truffle/Graal optimised interpreters). Finally, it makes available a plethora of third-party libraries.
